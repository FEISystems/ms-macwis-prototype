### Responsive Design

Prototype of Web Application, based on the context, development, could means screen mockup, wireframe or UI prototyping or all of these. FEi understand the concept of doing prototype in this response is to demonstrate the process and technologies used to create a responsive and interactive prototype based on one high level user story with agile methodologies.
As normally did after the agile (scrum) team assembled for this proposal, we had a quick planning meeting to setup one sprint (two weeks) process from start to finish this prototype, with common scrum configuration. See 2.1 for details.
During the initial planning meeting, we discussed 1) User Stories that include functional and non-functional stories 2) Move the product backlogs to sprint backlogs, based on the estimation and team capacity 3) Discussed couple ways of the prototyping and decide to use coding based approach that fully fit our needs. 4) And then team picked up the backlogs and started working on it.
The technologies we choose for this prototyping are 1) HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap/AngularJS framework based 2) Start from UI, with imported provider data as JSON data source 3) Setup a public github repository under FEiSystems account to share the development process.
We choose Bootstrap framework on top of HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript is based on 1) We used bootstrap as key components and front end framework for many projects 2) Bootstrap is powerful, poplar to create responsive, mobile first and cross devices web sites on the UI part.
We also choose to use AngularJS as the structural framework because 1) We need to build a dynamic web application prototype 2) We want the structure is clean and managed. AngularJS is used in many projects we worked on and it is ideal to work with Bootstrap to provide additional databinding and it is designed injectable and testable too. 
For the initial work, the scrum team draw the screen concept on the whiteboard, discussed the view of web components and layout in the different type of devices and then one team member who is primary on Front End development created and built the interactive code, checked-in and demo to the team in 2 days to then allow more refine and additional user stories to be implemented by this scrum team.
